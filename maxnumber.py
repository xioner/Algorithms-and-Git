QUESTION 1: MAXIMUM NUMBER
Design an algorithm that finds the maximum positive integer input by a user.  
The user repeatedly inputs numbers until a negative value is entered.
 
Make sure that you write up the algorithm before starting to code.
Then implement the algorithm in Python. Put your algorihmic description as a comment in the program file. """
# **********************************
# We take input of user of integer numbers
# once we take a number we compare it to the next number we take in 
# Once a negative value is entered we stop, and print out the largest integer that was entered.
#


num_int = int(input("Input a number: "))    # Do not change this line

while num_int > 0:
    num = int(input"Input a number: "))

print("The maximum is", max_int)    # Do not change this line
